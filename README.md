This repository provides reproducible implementations of seven representative methods that integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) into graph learning for node classification. Based on the survey by Li et al. (2024), we benchmark models across four major paradigms: LLM as Predictor, LLM as Enhancer, LLM for Alignment, and Others.
